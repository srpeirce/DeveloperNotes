# Test Driven Development (TDD)

TDD is so called because you write your tests before writing any functional code.

We usually follow the "Red, Green, Refactor" steps to write our tests.

## Red, Green, Refactor

### Red

First we write a test that will fail. You must run this test to ensure it is red.

This proves that the test is correctly failing, so that when we make the test pass we know this is a genuine pass.

> If the test touches a new method or function that doesn't exist, it's common to write the minimum amount of code so that the solution builds.

### Green

Next we write the minimum amount of code so that the tests pass.

> "That's stupid, we need patterns, and frameworks, and we need to do all the things" - Lot's of devs.

Is it really so stupid though? We often massively over complicate things, which adds complexity and takes longer to deliver business benefit. We can always refactor our code later (see the next point).

What happens if we add in all this extra effort now, and the project down the line never comes to fruition...we have just wasted lots of time.

### Refactor

Refactoring is to change the structure of the code, without making any functional changes.

## Types of tests

There are 2 main types of tests:

- Functional tests
- Unit tests
