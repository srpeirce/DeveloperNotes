### Kinect2 Timelapse - Unreleased windows store app

I got the kinect v2 dev sensor. I was working on a timelapse app...I thought it was cool to be able to timelapse capturing the differnt feeds from the kinect sensor.

Unfortunately I never completed it to a releasable state but it was a fun learning experience.

You could set a duration for timelapse to go, and how often to take a snap.

Effectively took a screenshot for each of the feeds (colour, depth, and infrared) which could be played back.

Unfortunately it was never as smooth as I wanted, I was hoping to perfect it for when windows store apps could run on the xbox but unfortunately other commitments took over, and by the time the xbox app store opened up the Kinect sensor was dead.

### Bingo+ - Windows 8 app

No longer on app storeâ€¦I made it as a simple learning experience for MVVM.

Simple bingo number calling app...the app chose a random order for bingo numbers that would then come onto the screen...animated in blend.

My mum was also going to write down the bingo numbers on bits of paper and pull them out of a hat for a christmas game...I had 2 days to make my app.

### Tap shot - Windows Phone 7 game

I made a fun little target shooter for windows phone 7.
This silverlight which ran on windows phone. 
I purchased image assets from stock sites, customising with photoshop.

Licences for sound effects and music also purchased.

> Tap shot had over 100k downloads. I have started re-making it in Unity 3d a couple of times but have never had the time to follow through :| I will one day!
