Sad times



A machine learning tool should
	- Forget about the fine detail (if I want to)
	- Embed ML in my application
	- Retain power
		○ I can goto low level if I need/want to


Azure Machine Learning Studio - tool to visually (non code-free)
	- Model
	- Train
	- Deploy (can deploy as web services)
		○ REST Api

Why all the fuss about machine learning?
	- Very heavy scary maths :'(
	- All the maths can be abstracted away, we can focus on actually doing stuff

3 main types
Supervised learning
	- Classification
	- Regression
	- Anomaly detection

Unsupervised
	- Clustering

Reinforcement
	- Agent based learning


Supervised example
	- Price of house and Square footage
		○ Create line of best fit











Linear regression gradient to find best gradient.




Unsupervised - Clusetering is one methof
	- People who paniv buy after 2cm of snow
	- Sane people

What are the patterns?
	- Might be easy to identify in small datasets for humans

	- Algorithms used by computers to identify stuff…scary maths!
		○ Transalates to some code



Don't believe the hype
	- Reality is techniques have been around for long time in research
	- Algorithms
	- Check if machine learning will actually solve the customers problem?


Date from blobs, tables, etc. ==> IDE   <======> API Interfaces <=====> Clients

Cortana intelligence gallery - can put cool stuff on store.

REST will work on pretty much any client.
